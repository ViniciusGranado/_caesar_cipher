        <h2>About Caesar Cipher</h2>

        <p>In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, or the shift cipher, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This position is called "Key". For example, with a key of 3, <b>A</b> would be replaced by <b>D</b>, <b>B</b> would become <b>E</b>, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.</p>
